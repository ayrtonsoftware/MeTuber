### Architecture Overview

MeTuber is an iOS video streaming application with a clean, modular architecture. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Core Components**:
   - PlayerVC: Main video player view controller that handles video playback
   - VideosVC: Grid view controller for displaying video thumbnails
   - VideoCell: Custom cell for displaying individual video thumbnails
   - VideoPlayerOverlayView: Custom overlay view for video player controls

2. **Data Management**:
   - IVideoManager: Protocol defining video management interface
   - JsonVideoManager: Implementation that loads videos from JSON (lazy loading is implemented)
   - Video: Data model for video content
   - IDownloadManager: Protocol for handling downloads
   - DownloadManager: Implementation with serial download queue

3. **Dependency Injection**:
   - Uses a custom DIContainer for dependency management
   - Services are registered in AppDelegate

### Key Design Patterns

1. **Protocol-Oriented Programming**:
   - Heavy use of protocols (IVideoManager, IDownloadManager) for abstraction
   - Enables easy swapping of implementations

2. **MVVM-like Architecture**:
   - View Controllers handle UI logic
   - Managers handle business logic
   - Clear separation of concerns

3. **Observer Pattern**:
   - Extensive use of KVO for player state management
   - Handles player status, rate, and item status changes

4. **Factory Pattern**:
   - WindowService for creating view controllers for the scene
   - DIContainer for service instantiation

### UI/UX Design

1. **Video Grid**:
   - 3-column grid layout
   - Custom VideoCell with thumbnail and description
   - Smooth scrolling with cell reuse

2. **Video Player**:
   - Custom overlay with gradient background
   - Progress slider
   - Description display
   - Gesture-based navigation (swipe up/down)

3. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Video preloading (3 videos ahead)
   - Serial download queue for thumbnails
   - Cell reuse in collection view

### Technical Features

1. **Video Playback**:
   - Uses AVPlayerViewController for robust video playback
   - Custom buffering strategy (30-second pre-buffer)
   - State management for play/pause

2. **Resource Management**:
   - Efficient thumbnail loading
   - Memory management with weak references
   - Proper cleanup of observers

3. **Navigation**:
   - Custom navigation system
   - Scene-based window management
   - Smooth transitions between views

### Current Issues

1. **Dependency Injection Module**:
   - There's a linter error indicating missing DependencyInjection module
   - This needs to be resolved for proper dependency management

### Recommendations

1. **Error Handling**:
   - Add more robust error handling for network failures
   - Implement retry mechanisms for failed downloads

2. **Caching**:
   - Implement thumbnail caching
   - Add video caching for offline playback

3. **Testing**:
   - Add unit tests for managers
   - Implement UI tests for critical flows

4. **Accessibility**:
   - Add accessibility labels
   - Implement VoiceOver support
